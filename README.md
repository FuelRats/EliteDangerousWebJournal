# Elite Dangerous: Web Journal Reader

I kinda wanted to see if I could make something in javascript to read the journal files in Elite Dangerous, and I could.

Only problem is that with JavaScript, I cannot monitor a folder and see if there are any new files (in case the journal rotates), so the user has to reselect their folder to refresh what the script can see.
